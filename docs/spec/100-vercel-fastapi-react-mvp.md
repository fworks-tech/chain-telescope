# Spec: Vercel FastAPI + React SPA (MVP)

## Problem

The project has a dual Streamlit + FastAPI architecture that cannot deploy to Vercel — the auto-detected `app.py` (Streamlit entrypoint) does not export a FastAPI instance. Vercel explicitly asks for `[tool.vercel] entrypoint = "src.api:app"`. Beyond this config fix, the architecture needs a forward path: a FastAPI-only deployment on Vercel with a modern SPA frontend, while keeping Streamlit intact as a local dev/fallback UI.

## Proposed Solution

Add a React SPA (Vite) in `frontend/` that consumes the existing FastAPI endpoints. Configure Vercel to serve both: FastAPI for all `/api/*` routes and the React SPA for all other routes. Keep the entire existing Streamlit codebase untouched — Streamlit remains fully functional locally (`streamlit run app.py`). Streamlit views are not deleted; they serve as the reference implementation for React component parity.

```

## Out of Scope

- Deleting or removing Streamlit code — Streamlit remains fully runnable
- Newsletter page in React MVP (can be added later)
- Alerts as a standalone page (alerts panel lives in the Dashboard)
- Authentication / user accounts
- SSR or Next.js — plain Vite SPA with client-side routing
- Tests for React components (manual QA during MVP)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `vercel.json` routes `/api/*` to `src/api.py` (FastAPI) and `/*` to the React SPA
- [ ] `pyproject.toml` has `[tool.vercel] entrypoint = "src.api:app"`
- [ ] React app renders at the Vercel deployment URL
- [ ] Dashboard page displays KPI row, price trend chart, news feed, risk graph, alerts panel
- [ ] News page lists news items from `/api/news`
- [ ] Risk page renders risk scores from `/api/snapshot`
- [ ] Assistant page sends/receives messages from the assistant API
- [ ] `streamlit run app.py` still works without any changes
- [ ] All 74 existing tests pass
- [ ] Ruff lint and format clean

## Testing Strategy

- Existing 74 unit tests must pass unchanged (proof that FastAPI + data layer is untouched)
- Manual QA on Vercel deployment URL for React pages
- No new Python tests needed — no Python code changes beyond `pyproject.toml`

## Open Questions

None.

## Migration Plan

This MVP is the first step of a gradual migration:
1. **MVP** (this spec) — FastAPI + React SPA with Dashboard, News, Risk pages; Coming Soon placeholders for missing components
2. **Phase 2** — Implement remaining components (see tracked issues):
   - [#98 Trending Report table](https://github.com/fworks-tech/hasheyes/issues/98)
   - [#99 Sidebar Filters](https://github.com/fworks-tech/hasheyes/issues/99)
   - [#100 Alerts standalone page](https://github.com/fworks-tech/hasheyes/issues/100)
   - [#101 Newsletter page](https://github.com/fworks-tech/hasheyes/issues/101)
   - [#102 Assistant API endpoint](https://github.com/fworks-tech/hasheyes/issues/102)
3. **Phase 3** — Deprecate Streamlit, remove `app.py` and `pages/`
