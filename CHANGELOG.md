## [0.3.0] — 2026-07-01

### Added

- Renamed project to HashHelm (was Jupyter-Crypto-Wizard).
- `st.navigation` routing in `app.py` — fully modular architecture via `pages/` → `src/views/` → `src/components/`.
- `src/logging.py` with centralized loguru sink configuration.
- `src/views/__init__.py` with `@st.cache_data(ttl=30)` cached snapshot wrapper.
- `src/styles.py` global CSS injection (wired into `app.py`).
- `notebooks/` directory with starter EDA notebook importing from `src/`.
- `docs/deployment.md` — Docker, domain setup, CI/CD guide.
- `docs/operations.md` — production runbook with health checks, monitoring, backups, incident response.
- `docs/development.md` — contributor guide with setup, conventions, workflow.
- `docs/adr/001-stack-recommendations.md` — architecture review and library upgrade roadmap.
- `loguru` structured logging across market, news, and newsletter modules.
- `tenacity` retry with exponential backoff on all three exchange API fetchers.
- 8 new tests: `test_caching.py`, `test_retry.py`, `test_logging.py` (43 total).
- PR automation: `scripts/pr-skill.py` (create/validate/summary subcommands).

### Changed

- `app.py` rewritten from 160 lines to 22 — delegates to modular architecture.
- Docs consolidated: `m4-data-pipelines.md`, `validation-and-manual-qa.md`, `agent-skills.md` merged into `Architecture.md` or deleted.
- `AGENTS.md` rewritten with verified facts, sidebar filter docs, 3 market providers.

### Removed

- Inline rendering and sidebar widgets from `app.py` (now in `src/views/` and `src/app_shell.py`).
- 8 unused dependencies: `matplotlib`, `torch`, `torchvision`, `tqdm`, `fonttools`, `filelock`, `Pygments`, `schedule`.
- `scripts/QUICK_REF.md` (duplicate of `PR_SKILL_GUIDE.md`).
- Jupyter vestiges: stale notebooks scope in `pr-skill.py`, dead references in docs.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-12

### Added

- Routed Streamlit navigation for Dashboard, Alerts, News, Risk, and Newsletter pages.
- Shared sidebar filters in `src/app_shell.py` for time window and watchlist selection.
- Filter-aware `DashboardSnapshot` assembly in `src/data/dashboard_query.py`.
- Market ingestion adapters with Binance and CoinGecko fallbacks to mock data.
- RSS/Atom news ingestion with normalized feed items and safe fallback content.
- MVP alert rules and local newsletter persistence with stub delivery.
- AI assistant grounding from the shared dashboard snapshot with provider fallbacks.
- Launcher helpers in `scripts/run-app.ps1` and `scripts/run_app.py`.
- Expanded unit and smoke coverage, including Streamlit `AppTest` entrypoint checks.
- Layered CI jobs for tests, compile checks, Ruff lint/format, and advisory maintainability rules.
- Documentation for configuration, M4 pipelines, validation, and manual QA.

### Changed

- Modularized the dashboard into routed pages, views, and snapshot-driven components.
- Hardened feed rendering by escaping untrusted news titles in HTML panels.
- Normalized provider timestamps in market service output for chart consistency.

### Removed

- Legacy single-page sidebar navigation component in favor of `st.navigation` routes.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-12

### Added

- Initial Streamlit dashboard baseline in `app.py`.
- README runbook, validation checklists, and `docs/Architecture.md`.
- Python ignore rules for virtual environments, caches, and local env files.
